## Algorithms

This repository share set of algorithms implemented by me in the course of algorithmic and complexity in Java. 
Some algorithms might not work because I would not have understood the principle. :) if this is the case, please report me :)
## List of algorithms:

> ### DPR:

>* Majority element of a vector
>* Convex envelope of a set

>DYNAMIC PROGRAMMING:
>* fibonacci sequence
>* travelling salesman
>* local and global sequence alignment
>* integer-valued knapsack problem
>* Return of money
>* Good parenthesis of a product of n matrices
longest common sub-sequence of 2 strings
